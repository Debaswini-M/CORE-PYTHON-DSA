# Linear Search in Python

A simple and clean implementation of linear search that supports
searching for multiple target values in a list.

## Features
- Accepts multiple search inputs
- Returns index if the element is found
- Gracefully handles missing values
- Beginner-friendly and readable logic

## Example

Input:
22,4,66

Output:
Sorry, Dude! The number 22 doesn't exist in the list.
Number 4 found in the list at index 3
Sorry, Dude! The number 66 doesn't exist in the list.

## What I Learned
- Difference between values and indices in Python loops
- Proper use of dictionaries for result mapping
- Debugging iterator and method-call issues (`items()`)

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
